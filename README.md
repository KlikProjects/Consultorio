## Concept
***

Handy App is an app that allows workers from the company to request an appointment with the CTO to solve technical problems of the development team. The CTO has a view that let him/her see all the appoitments required from de coders, the CTO has a user button to change the view and return to the main page.
The coders start with the main page that let them insert an appointment with his/her name and consult, the coder can edit and delete the appointment.
The user securities are not implemented yet.

## Design
***
The design was made with figma after thinking which was the best option to write concise doubts related with technical issues in an engaging and handy way at the same time that it also would be handy and attracktive for the CTO in order to have all the requests in one same place following an order to know which one to asnwer first.
